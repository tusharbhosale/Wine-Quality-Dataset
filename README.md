# Red-Wine-Quality-Dataset

There are 1599 examples of Red wines in Dataset

Goal is to predict quality of wine based on following input variables

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

This project used logistic regression, use gradient discent and scipy optimizer to minimize cost.
